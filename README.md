Charro can generate your private Spotify playlist based on your most listened tracks from either Last.fm or Spotify services.

This was made purely for Go learning purposes, but some might find useful tool to generate Spotify playlists (me). I've included logging connected users to Postgres DB just out of curiosity.

Too lazy to add tests, might do it later.
